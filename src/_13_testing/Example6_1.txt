Who is going to use ATM? anyone, blind people
What are they going to use it for? Withdrawing money. Transferring money, Checking Balance
Do we have access to code or just to ATM?

Break system into components

Transfering money

Use mix of manual and automated testing
Execute above tasks manually in cases low balance, new account, nonexistent account

Automated testing: Automate standard scenarios and specific issues such as race conditions
Even if deposit and withdrawal take place from different location you never get or lose money that you should'nt

Prioritize security and reliability
Peoples accounts must be protected, Money is always accounted for. No one unexpectedly loses money
