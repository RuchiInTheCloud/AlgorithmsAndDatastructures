Load test a webpage without using any test tools

Load testing is done to identify a web applications maximum operating capacity, as well as any bottlenecks that may
interfere with its performance.

Identify performance critical scenarios:

Metrics:
Response time
Throughput
Resource utilization
Maximum load that a system can bear

Design tests to simulate the load, measure each criterion
Simulate concurrent users by creating a multithreaded program with thousands of threads where each thread acts as a
 real world user loading a page. For each user measure response time, data I/O etc.

We would then analyze results gathered and compare it with accepted values
