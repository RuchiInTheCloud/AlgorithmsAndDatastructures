Random crashes: Application written using c standard library crashes when run everytime in a different place.
Application is single threaded

General causes for random errors:
Random variable: Application uses a random variable that is not fixed for every execution e.g. user input. Time of day,
random number generated by the program.
Uninitialized variable: Takes an arbitrary value in each execution
Memory leak: Program may run out of memory. Depends on total processes running at that particular time. Heap overflow or
corruption of data on stack
External dependencies: The program may depend on other application, machine or resource.

Learn as much as possible about the application
Who is running it?
What are they doing with it?
What kind of application is it?

Application crash may be linked to certain components or scenarios?
E.g. During file load or file I/O.

Close down all other applications.
Track resource use
Disable parts of the program
Run it on a different machine
Eliminate to track down the issue

Use tools to check for situations
Use runtime tools to check for unintialized variables

Brainstorm and approach in a systematic way
