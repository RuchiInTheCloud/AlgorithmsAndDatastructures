//20 bottles of pills
//19 bottles contain pills of 1g
//One bottle contains pills of 1.1g
//Given a scale that provides exact measurement
//Find the heavy bottle
//
//If all bottles contained 1g pills and we took
//1 pill from 1st bottle and 2 pills from second bottle and so on...
//The scale would measure as 1 + 2 + 3 + .. + 20 = 20 * 21/2 = 210g
//Since one of the bottles contain pills of 1.1g the scale would return >210g
//(total weight - 210)/0.1 ==> would point to the bottle containing 1.1 g of pills
