Paste bin: Enter piece of text and randomly generated URL for public access

Scope the problem
- System does not support user accounts or editing documents
- System tracks analytics of how often a page is accessed
- Old documents get deleted after not being accessed for a long time
- No authentication to access documents, not possible to guess URL easily
- System has frontend as well as API
- Analytics of each URL can be accessed through stats link on each page. Not shown by default

Make reasonable assumptions
- System gets heavy traffic
- Contains millions of documents
- Traffic not equally distributed across documents. Some accessed more frequently than others.
