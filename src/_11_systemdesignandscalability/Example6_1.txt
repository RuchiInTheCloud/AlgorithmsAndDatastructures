E commerce company wants to list best selling product overall and by category.

Scope the problem
- design components relevant to the question. Touch frontend and purchase component as it impacts sales rank
- Sales rank: Total sales over past week
- Each product can be in multiple categories, no subcategories

Make reasonable assumption
- Stats don't need to be 100% up to date
- Data an hour old for popular item (top 100), a day old for less popular
- Precision important for popular items, small degree of error okay for less popular items
- Data updated every hour for most popular item, the time range need not be las 7 days (168 hours). 150 hours is ok.
- Categorization based on seller
(you may need to make other assumptions along the way)

Draw the major components
- Purchase system --> orders added --> DB
- Sales rank data cache <-- reads data by category, compute sales, sort it <-- DB
- Frontend <-- reads <-- sales rank data cache

Identify the key issues
- Analytics are expensive
-- Querying for number of sales in past week is expensive, since one needs to look at sales for all time
-- Store total sales from last week, each purchase updates the total weekly sales
--- If we use single field to keep track of total sales in the past week, we need to recompute every day the total sales
--- Instead keep track of total sales in a day: Product ID, Total, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat
---- Each day clear out the day of the week, we update the sales count for the product on that day of the week and total count
--- Product ID, Category ID
---- Join the two tables to calculate the rank of products in a category

- Database writes are very frequent
-- Batch up database writes
-- Periodically process the log and update the totals
--- 10 million products. Store product id and count in as table
--- product id: 4 bytes. Can store 4 billion unique IDs = 16 GB
--- count is 4 bytes. 4 billion counts = 16 GB
--- 10 million products = 80 MB
-- Rerun sales rank after database update
--- Divide log by time period. Update database with log and compute sales rank

- Joins are expensive
-- tens of thousands of product categories. For every category, pull data for its items and sort
-- Alternatively, join product and categories. Sort on category, sales volume. Walk the results to get the sales rank for each category
-- Sort entire table on sales number to get overall rank
-- Keep data joined, multiple updates then needed per product if it belongs to multiple categories

- Database queries can still be expensive
-- Just keep log files and use Map Reduce
--- Write a purchase in a text file with product id and time stamp
--- Each category has a directory, write to all categories associated with the product
--- Run frequent jobs to merge files by product ID and time range (day, hour)
---- /sportequiment: 1423, Dec 13, 2021, 1; 1410, Dec 13, 2021, 5
--- Next sort the lines in a category directory
-- Overall ranking
--- Write every purchase in a general directory
--- Execute N way merge?
---- Look at two categories and construct the top 100, then compare this result with another category (pairwise merge)
---- Run this work once a day
---- Divide files on multiple servers, as they are not dependent on each other
