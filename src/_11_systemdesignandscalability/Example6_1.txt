E commerce company wants to list best selling product overall and by category.

Scope the problem
- design components relevant to the question. Touch frontend and purchase component as it impacts sales rank
- Sales rank: Total sales over past week
- Each product can be in multiple categories, no subcategories

Make reasonable assumption
- Stats don't need to be 100% up to date
- Data an hour old for popular item (top 100), a day old for less popular
- Precision important for popular items, small degree of error okay for less popular items
- Data updated every hour for most popular item, the time range need not be las 7 days (168 hours). 150 hours is ok.
- Categorization based on seller
(you may need to make other assumptions along the way)
