Personal finance manager: connects to your bank accounts and analyses your spending habits and makes recommendations

Scope the problem:
- Create an account, add your bank accounts. Also add at a later point in time
- Pulls your financial history as much allowed by the bank account
-- History: outgoing money, incoming money, current money (in bank + investments)
-- Each transaction has a category associated with it
-- Data source which can associate a category with  transaction. Override of estimated category possible
- Get recommendations on spending from a mix of users. Not to spend more than x% on clothing. Can be overriden by custom budgets.
- Just a website
- Receive notifications either regular basis or based on certain conditions: spending over certain threshold, hitting a budget max
- No concept of user specified rules for assigning categories to transactions

Make reasonable assumptions:
- Adding or removing a bank account is relatively unusual
- System is write heavy. Several transactions daily.
- Few users access website more than once a week. Interact with the system through notification
- Once transaction assigned a category, it can be changed by the user. System never changes assignment. Two identical transactions may be assigned to different category if the rules change.
- Banks dont push data to the system. It needs to pull the data.
- Alerts on users exceeding budget can be 24 hours delayed.
