//Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe
//Does hasWon have to be called once or several times (website). If latter is the case, we may want to add preprocessing time to improve runtime of hasWon
//Do we know the last move made?
//Do we design for 3X3 board or NXN board
//Prioritize compactness of code vs speed of execution vs clarity of code? Most efficient not best, should also be easy to understand and maintainable
//Solution 4: NXN board
