Design database to store student grades
Create SQL query to return a list of honor roll students (top 10%) sorted by their gpa

Students: StudentID, StudentName, Address, personal information
Courses: CourseID, CourseName, ProfessorID, course description etc.
CourseEnrollment: CourseID, StudentID, Grade, Term

DECLARE @GpaCutOff float;

SET @GpaCutOff = select min(gpa) as 'GPAMin' from (
    select top 10 percent avg(grade) as gpa
    from courseenrollment
    group by studentid
    order by gpa desc
) grades;

Select students.studentName, gpa
from (select studentID, avg(grade) as gpa from courseenrollment group by studentid having avg(grade) >= @gpacutoff)
honors inner join students on honors.studentID = students.studentID

Assumption: course taught by one teacher. this increases flexibility and complexity
Make design reasonably flexible and state assumptions
