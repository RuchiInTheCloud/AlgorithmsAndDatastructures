AVL Tree: Used to implement tree balancing
Every node stores height of subtree rooted at this node
Height of left and right subtree should differ by no more than 1
-1 <= balance(n) = n.left.height - n.right.height <= 1

Insertion: Balance may change to 2 or -2
During unwind of recursive stack, check and balance each node by rotation
