Synchronized Methods: Class with synchronized method A and normal method B

If you have two threads in one instance of a program, can they both execute A at the same time? Can they execute A and B
at the same time?

Only one synchronized method can be in execution per instance of an object
Other threads can execute non synchronized methods on that instance or they can execute any method on a different instance
of the class

A synchronized method applies locks on all synchronized methods in that instance of the object. This blocks other threads
from executing synchronized methods within that instance.
