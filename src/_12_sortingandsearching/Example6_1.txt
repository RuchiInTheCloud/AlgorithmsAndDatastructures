20GB file with one string per line
How to sort this file?

20GB will not fit in memory
8GB ram possible, 4GB ram common

Divide file in x megabyte chunks, x is the amount of memory available.
Each chunk is sorted separately and saved to file system.
Merge chunks one by one. At the end we have a fully sorted file.

This algorithm is called external sort.
